# AppDev2_TeamProject

Project created by Nafees Syed and Maria Ramlochan

Project for Application Development (Mobile)

The project has for goal to create an application that will help reduce food waste within city limits. The idea of the project was to enable food focused business such as 
restaurant, catering and grocerie store, which generates a lot of food waste and connect them to local food banks. Instead of throwing their food in the garbage, businesses
will be able to snap a picture of the food via the application created so that the food banks can contact the owner and schedule a pick up. 

The app will have 2 users, donor and food bank. The donor user will be able to snap a pic and attach a description and post it. once a donation has been posted, both donor and
food bank will be able to view on their respective donation page. The food bank user will have the choice to accept which ever donation they would like and the have the choice to
click on the donor phone number to be able to contact them easily. On the donor side, they will be able to delete the post if they would like and posts that have been accepted by 
food bank user will appear in the past post of the donor page.

Both will be able to change some information directly from the setting menu such as change their password etc.
